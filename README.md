# Variant-Interpretation-Tool-
An html tool built by generative AI (ChatGPT + GitHub Copilot) used to document evidence and calculate pathogenicity for germline variants. Criteria is based on ACMG/AMP guidelines (Richards 2015, PMID: 25741868).

The following additional files are also uploaded for customization if needed: 
1. pathogenicity_combinations.txt --> All pathogenicity combinations used for the pathogenicity calculation
2. Double_Dipping_Criteria.txt --> Double-dipping combinations used
3. Tools.txt --> Tools in the dropdown for each code
